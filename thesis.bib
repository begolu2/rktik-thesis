@article{Boyd2012,
abstract = {Facebook's terms of service explicitly require its users to provide their "real names and information." Thus, when Google+ launched in the summer of 2011, it tried to emulate Facebook by requiring that new users provide similar credentials. The digerati responded with outrage, angry with Google for its totalitarian approach. While the furor over "real names" has subsided, key questions about the role of identity, privacy, and control remain. This column explores these issues, highlighting the challenges involved in designing socio-technical systems. As Facebook spread beyond college campuses, not all new users embraced the "real names" norm. During the course of the author's research, she found that late-teen adopters were far less likely to use their given name. Accountability is commonly raised as one of the reasons behind which people should provide identifiable information in online settings. The "real names" debate goes beyond identification technologies and economic interests.},
